Giovanni Mancini couldn’t fall asleep. His body was restless. All he could smell was gunpowder. His ears were ringing. He fought to keep his eyes closed but an endless loop played on his eyelids. Tomorrow, he was being shot out of a cannon, wearing only the clothes on his back, in to a mesh netting one hundred and fourteen feet away.

Mancini had done it once before. It was exhilarating. It reminded him of days when he was going too fast around the corners of winding roads. The air on his face felt like car rides with the windows down, moving towards no destination. He trusted he was going somewhere, he just didn’t know where yet.

The moon went down and the sun came up. Gio was anxious but calm. He knew what to expect: anything. That’s what he was prepared for.

The morning of June 3rd was a blur until he arrived at the launch site, the 1934 Idaho State Fair. He didn’t notice the crowd, I couldn’t tell you how many were in attendance. After getting dressed, Giovanni Mancini looked in the mirror at his audience of one.

He walked with confidence to the podium. He wore his country’s colours. His eyes were glazed over, deep in concentration. All he could see was that mesh netting. He didn’t know how he was going to get there but he knew he would do it.

Mancini lowered himself in to the cannon and got in to position. The announcer counted down — 3, 2, 1. The cannon exploded with a strong push. He was airborne. It was different than the first time but eerily similar. Flying through the air, ninety miles an hour, Giovanni Mancini’s eyes were fixed on his destination.
