On February 14, 2016, Kanye West released the first version of his seventh studio album, The Life of Pablo (TLOP). In the months previous, Kanye changed the album title and tracklist multiple times. He documented a lot of the process on social media.

He premiered the album on February 11, 2016, at Madison Square Garden. Three days later, members of Tidal, an artist-run streaming service, essentially got to beta test Kanye’s latest creation. 

For the month following the release of TLOP, Tidal was the only place fans could listen to it officially. During that time, West updated the music, in real time. He changed tracklists, features, lyrics and vocal effects.

Notable changes include adding Sia, Vic Mensa, and an extra 1m9secs to “Wolves”, removing Frank Ocean from the same song and giving him his own song, titled “Frank’s Track”, and altering a line in “Famous” from “She be Puerto Rican Day parade wavin” to “She in school to be a real estate agent”.

As part of the rollout, Kanye continued to work on an unedited, incomplete version of his album. Did Kanye do this deliberately? I think Kanye is more deliberate than most people give him credit for but that’s beside the point. Kanye treated his album like software and released it in beta. He gathered feedback, learned, iterated, improved, and released it, again and again.

There’s nothing wrong with that.

Authors re-release books, often years later, and they make updates. It’s hard to make things perfect the first time around. Good enough is good enough, and perfection is its enemy.

That’s my aim with this blog. Rather than tweaking endlessly, I’ll publish my work knowing that it will grow and evolve.

Sometimes that means the thoughts I share will be incomplete and that’s okay. In a way, any creative endeavor is like wading into the unknown. Creativity forces me to learn on the go, to take small steps and to evaluate and improve.

I think about writing these blog posts in a similar way to how tech startups think about their first release of software. Reid Hoffman says, “If you are not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you’ve launched too late.” Startups are advised to ship early. This first version is referred to as the beta.

Beta versions are generally released to an initial set of users before the product is ready for the whole world to see. Beta launches test assumptions. “Do people really want what we’re making?” Done right, beta testing turns a product experience into a conversation, between creator and consumer. Beta testing allows creatives to learn quickly and make improvements from what they learn.

It’s a powerful concept that should be applied across disciplines. As a writer, it’s better if I release these articles in beta rather than attempt to perfect my craft by candlelight.

Writing is a process. According to John McPhee, it’s about knowing what to leave in and what to take out. The act of writing helps me clarify my thoughts. It’s important to say what I want to say, but that doesn’t always come out neatly packaged with a bow on top after the first go around.

Furthermore, where I stand changes as I experience life. After a certain point, more editing offers diminishing returns. I embrace what’s unfinished and remind myself to just [ship it](https://sethgodin.typepad.com/files/theshipitjournal.pdf).

There is a paradox at work here.

Great authors reiterate that writing is rewriting. Truman Capote said, “Good writing is rewriting.” Roald Dahl said, “Good writing is essentially rewriting.” E.B. White said, “The best writing is rewriting.” Ernest Hemingway said, “The only kind of writing is rewriting.” You get the point.

But constant tinkering is a trap. It can be dangerous to do too much. Who says that records, pieces of writing, software, whatever have to be ‘finished’? I may be at risk of over philosophizing here but what does ‘done’ mean anyway?

Pablo Picasso asked:

> “Have you ever seen a finished picture? A picture or anything else? Woe unto you the day it is said that you are finished! To finish a work? To finish a picture? What nonsense! To finish it means to be through with it, to kill, to rid it of its soul, to give it its final blow: the most unfortunate one for the painter as well as for the picture.”

Art belongs on people’s walls, not on the floors of studios. In fact, finishing (or knowing when something is ‘done’) is more art than craft itself. Picasso realized this. And Kanye heeded his words when he released The Life of Pablo. Maybe the title was an ode to a certain Pablo from the past. I believe that art doesn’t need to be ‘finished’ and that “living breathing changing creative expression” is enlightening for those who experience it and freeing for those who create it.

For me, adopting the idea of being in beta doesn’t stop at this article or in my writing. I carry it over to other creative endeavors and even to life itself.
