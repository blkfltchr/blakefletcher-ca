I didnâ€™t have a name or website, but I did have a business model. Unlike most projects I start, Sprout Online was mostly about the money. I enlisted personal assistants from Asia to crawl through Google Maps and send me links to small businesses with old websites. I then quickly created demos and went door-to-door to sell my services. We focused on website design and digital marketing.</p>
