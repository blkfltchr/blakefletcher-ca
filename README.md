# BlakeFletcher.ca

My personal website, bootstrapped with `gatsby-starter-hello-word`.

Install this starter (assuming Gatsby is installed) by running from your CLI:
```
gatsby new gatsby-site https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world
```

[Wiew the live demo here](https://blakefletcher-ca.netlify.com/).

## Running in development
`gatsby develop`
